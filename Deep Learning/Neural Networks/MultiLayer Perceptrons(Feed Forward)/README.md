# Feedforward Neural Networks Hub

**Location:** `Machine-Learning/Deep Learning/Neural Networks/MultiLayer Perceptrons(Feed Forward)`

Centralise fully-connected neural network examples here. Use this directory for tabular classification and regression notebooks, PyTorch training loops, and FastAPI adapters that rely on feedforward architectures. This keeps deep learning content under the dedicated Deep Learning namespace rather than the supervised/unsupervised trees.

## Suggested Structure

- `datasets/` — Tabular datasets prepared for neural training.
- `src/` — PyTorch modules, training scripts, evaluation routines.
- `notebooks/` — Experimentation notebooks for architecture tuning and learning curves.
- `artifacts/` — Saved model checkpoints and metrics.

Add subdirectories as needed (e.g., `classification/`, `regression/`) while keeping the entire implementation under this Deep Learning branch.
