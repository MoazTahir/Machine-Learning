# Agglomerative Clustering

**Location:** `Machine-Learning/Unsupervised Learning/Agglomerative Clustering`

Hierarchical clustering builds nested clusters by iteratively merging the two closest groups. Use it when you need dendrogram visualisations or when the number of clusters is unknown. This module follows the repo’s standard layout (data, src, notebooks, artifacts, demo) so you can plug dendrogram analysis into existing pipelines.
