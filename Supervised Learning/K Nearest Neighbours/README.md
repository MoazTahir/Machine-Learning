# K-Nearest Neighbours Modules

This directory groups the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) implementations for both classification and regression tasks. Each subfolder mirrors the repository-wide supervised-learning structure: reproducible configuration, scripted training, persisted artefacts, FastAPI integration, exploratory notebooks, and demo scripts.

## Submodules

- `Classification/` — multi-class wine classification using distance-weighted KNN.
- `Regression/` — diabetes progression regression using distance-weighted KNN.

Refer to the README inside each submodule for detailed instructions, datasets, and extension ideas.
