# Regularised Linear Models Suite

**Location:** `Machine-Learning/Supervised Learning/Regularized Linear Models`

This collection extends the linear regression baseline with L2, L1, and elastic-net penalties. Use these modules when multicollinearity, high-dimensional feature spaces, or sparse solutions matter. Each subdirectory mirrors the standard repository structure so you can train, evaluate, and serve models consistently.

## Modules

- `Ridge Regression/` — L2-penalised regression with coefficient shrinkage (fully scaffolded with code and dataset).
- `Lasso Regression/` — L1-penalised regression driving coefficients to zero for feature selection.
- `Elastic Net/` — Hybrid L1/L2 penalty balancing shrinkage and sparsity.

Follow the README inside each module for dataset notes, training commands, and integration guidance.
