# Probability Calibration

**Location:** `Machine-Learning/Supervised Learning/Calibration`

Reliable probabilities are critical for thresholding, risk scoring, and cost-sensitive decisions. This suite demonstrates two popular calibration techniques built atop a logistic regression backbone.

- `Platt Scaling/` — Fits a sigmoid on top of raw scores.
- `Isotonic Regression/` — Learns a monotonic step-wise mapping for flexible calibration.

Each module preserves the repo’s standard structure with datasets, src code, notebooks, artifacts, and demos.
